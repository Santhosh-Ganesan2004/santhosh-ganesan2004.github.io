# DSA Day 1
how
## Introduction

Today was my day one on beginning my journey on DSA to crack coding and interviews!!

## Beginning of journey

So I began my journey by searching how to start coding since my coding skills is very poor and weak. So I used ChatGpt and spoke to my friend (Hemnath) on how do I start it, and they gave me the approach of learning pattern wise than topic wise.

### Strategical Approach

So I began to list out different patterns and started to code. I used neetcode150, where they provide pattern wise set of questions. Since it is my day one, with almost 0 knowledge of DSA, I had to look up solutions for a few questions. I also looked up at syntaxes for my approach since i didn't know it.

### Personal Understanding

I tried solving questions based on my personal approach, to see if I am able to solve questions properly, And I am able to! But DSA coding is not just about solving the problem, it is also about getting the most optimal solution for a given problem.
Today i solved about 5-6 questions.

## Key Learnings

- Arrays
- HashMap

## Conclusion

I believe it is a step towards framing and securing my future.I am not sure if i am too late or no, but i believe in the saying "It's never too late to start.".
It is a start, and sign of improvement!!
